SVGPath2Text
============

A brute force tool to convert SVG Outlines (aka SVG Path; SVG Glyphes) back to text. Helpful if you need smaller file sizes.

A Demo-SVG-File is included. This Tool maps the Glyphs (i.e. SVG Pathes) from a template to the elements found in a SVG File. 

This is just a dirty hack ;-) It currently only works for the font  "Comic Sans MS" in file size 7px; Most of the letters in the demo file are found correctly, but placement still needs improvement. To alter this work you need to change the "template letters" to your font and font size.

Uses BATIK to convert Glyphs BACK to text, i.e. parse the pathes to Java objects. (http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/) You need to add the approbiate LIBS to the project. (http://www.cs.hs-rm.de/~knauf/SWTProjekt2008/batik/index.html)

The SVG File needs to be 'norrmalized' by copy it to the Source editor of Method Draw (http://editor.method.ac/) into the source editor (View --> Source) and paste it back into the SVG File.

To use this HACK copy it to NETBEANS (8 w/ Java 8) and run "ExtraktLettersFromPath.java" then edit the word puzzle in INKSPACE (http://www.inkscape.org/de/) and run "RemoveAllRedPathes.java" to remove all obsolete pathes.
